i42 - A DevOps automation support library
=========================================

i42 is a DevOps automation support library that enables the programmatic use of
various development/deployment tools and platforms. It is meant to support multiple
platforms and technologies and to promote interoperability and cross platform
compatibility. i42 is distributed as open source software under the MIT license
and is fully written in the Sling programming language.

Compiling i42
-------------

The Sling compiler is distributed in Javascript format through NPM. To compile i42,
you will therefore need to install Node.JS (v16 or higher), which includes NPM. Then
run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This performs a full build of all modules of i42 and produces Javascript code as
the output. The compiled version of the library is then found in the "dist"
subdirectory.
